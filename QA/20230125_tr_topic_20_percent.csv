Emissions are generated from fuel combustion by both air and road freight operations. Given the altitude of the emissions from jet fuel, air freight makes an especially potent contribution to climate change. Management of GHG emissions is likely to affect air freight and logistics companies’ cost structure over time, as emissions are tied directly to fuel use, and thus to operating expenses. Fuel efficiency and the use of alternative fuels offers a way for companies to reduce fuel costs and/or limit exposure to volatile fuel pricing, future regulatory costs, and other consequences of GHG emissions. While newer aircraft and trucks are generally more fuel-efficient, existing fleets may be retrofitted. Capital investments in more fuel-efficient airplanes and/or vehicles and emerging fuel-management technology may potentially reduce ongoing fuel expenses and improve profitability.

Critical aspects of this issue include employee health and safety, fair pay, child labor, and forced labor. Although companies continue to improve performance on this issue, the industry’s reliance on a multitiered system of suppliers, subcontractors, labor recruitment firms, and part- time workers makes it difficult to manage. Because companies in the industry typically contract with suppliers in countries with the lowest direct costs, the industry’s products are often manufactured in countries that have limited regulations or enforcement protecting workers. This dynamic can heighten a company’s exposure to reputational risks and impacts on short- and long-term costs and sales. Such effects can arise from increasing regulation and its enforcement in response to high-profile safety or labor incidents, production disruptions due to strikes and other labor-related work stoppages, or through a shift in demand away from companies associated with such incidents.

96,"Asset managers and custodian banks have the potential to pose, amplify, or transmit a threat to the financial system. Liquidity, leverage, and interconnectedness of assets under management are the factors that highlight exposure to systemic risk for companies in the industry. Understanding the level of exposure to each of these factors and the narrative around management of such exposure can help investors assess companies’ performance levels on this issue. Total exposure to securities financing transactions (SFT) provides a measure of a company’s interconnectedness and the extent to which it can absorb shocks arising from economic stress, whether internal or stemming from other market participants. Moreover, secured lending and borrowing in the form of SFTs is an important source of leverage for asset managers. Meanwhile, disclosing the distribution of assets classified under broad buckets of expected liquidity allows for a more granular understanding of the underlying risk of sudden outflows, i.e., redemption risk. The regulatory environment around the issue of systemic risk in the Asset Management & Custody Activities industry is likely to continue to evolve. Companies in this industry designated by regulators as systemically important financial institutions are subject to stricter prudential regulatory standards and oversight by the central banking systems in various jurisdictions. Asset managers will likely face limitations relating to risk-based capital, leverage, liquidity, and credit exposure. In addition, firms will be required to maintain a plan for rapid and orderly dissolution in the event of financial distress.

Regulations surrounding the Asset Management & Custody Activities industry are intended to align the interests of companies and their clients and to limit conflicts of interest. This alignment, coupled with the fact that most asset managers earn fees based on the amount of assets under management, provides a significant incentive for companies to provide clients with strategies that match their risk-return profiles. Despite required disclosures, companies still face significant challenges in ensuring that clients understand the nature of risks taken in investment strategies. Failure to provide services that satisfy customer expectations may result in lengthy and costly litigation, diminished trust with clients, and lower sales as a result. Enhanced disclosure on procedures or programs to provide adequate, clear, and transparent information about products and services, the regulatory violation record of employees, and the amount of fines and settlements associated with professional integrity will provide investors with an advanced understanding of how well companies manage risks associated with this issue and whether they are able to preserve long-term value for shareholders.",0,,,,,52,1,,,,,,False,,,30,False

145,"The rapid growth in global biofuels production is due in large part to government energy policies that seek to reduce net GHG emissions from transportation fuels and reduce dependence on fossil fuels. Most major renewable-fuel policies worldwide require that biofuels achieve lifecycle GHG emissions reductions relative to a fossil-fuel baseline to qualify for renewable fuel-mandate thresholds. The biofuel lifecycle emission calculation can include indirect and direct emissions from feedstock crop production and land use, fuel refining, fuel and feedstock transport, and vehicle exhaust emissions. Biofuel producers can directly influence net emissions during the refining process through energy management (fuel use), process innovations, and by using feedstocks with lower emissions profiles. Fuel products that achieve a reduction in net emissions can qualify as advanced biofuels, which, based on existing biofuels mandates in the U.S. and Europe, may be subject to increased demand in the future. Biofuel companies that cost-effectively reduce the net carbon emissions of their products may gain a competitive product advantage, leading to revenue growth and increased market share.",0,,,,,65,1,,,,,,False,,,15,False

While regulatory support can result in positive short-term gains by supporting the biofuels market, the potential long-term adverse environmental impacts from feedstock and biofuels production may result in a reversal of beneficial policies, leading to a more uncertain regulatory environment.

Globally, regulations and policies are and may continue to be put into place to limit GHG emissions from coal-fired power plants—the customers of coal companies—thus lowering the demand for, and subsequently the prices of, coal. Coal demand is also being affected by regulations governing other harmful air emissions that apply to coal-fired power plants.

226,"The production of construction materials requires a significant quantity of energy, sourced primarily from direct combustion of fossil fuels as well as from purchased electricity. Energy-intense production has implications for climate change, and electricity purchases from the grid can create indirect Scope 2 emissions. Construction materials companies also use alternative fuels for their kilns, such as scrap tires and waste oil—often waste generated by other industries. If properly managed, these can lower energy costs and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. However, there could be potentially negative impacts, such as releases of harmful air pollutants that companies need to minimize in order to obtain net benefits from using such fuels. Decisions about use of alternative fuels, renewable energy, and on-site generation of electricity (versus purchases from the grid) can play an important role in influencing both the costs and reliability of energy supply. Affordable, easily accessible, and reliable energy is an important competitive factor in this industry, with purchased fuels and electricity accounting for a significant proportion of total production costs. The way in which a construction materials company manages its overall energy efficiency, its reliance on different types of energy and associated sustainability risks, and its ability to access alternative sources of energy can influence its profitability.",0,,,,,9,1,,,,,,False,,,14,False

278,"Employees are key contributors to value creation in the E-Commerce industry. While the number of job openings in the industry continues to grow, companies are finding it difficult to recruit qualified employees to fill these positions. In key markets, a shortage of technically skilled domestic workers has created intense competition to acquire such employees, contributing to high turnover rates. This competition for talent and the search for innovation opportunities presents several interrelated sustainability challenges regarding human capital that companies must manage. Hiring foreign nationals to compensate for shortages in local talent can create risks related to perceived social implications in the host and home countries of workers. Companies offer significant monetary and nonmonetary benefits to improve employee engagement and, therefore, retention and productivity. Initiatives to improve employee engagement and work-life balance might influence the recruitment and retention of a diverse workforce. As the industry is characterized by relatively low representation from women and minority groups, efforts to recruit from and develop diverse talent pools can serve to address the talent shortage and generally to improve the value of company offerings.

294,"Energy efficiency is a low-lifecycle-cost method to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, as less electricity needs to be generated to provide the same end-use energy services. Utilities can partake in a wide range of activities to promote energy efficiency and conservation among their customers. Such strategies include offering rebates for energy-efficient appliances, weatherizing customers’ homes, educating customers on energy-saving methods, offering incentives to customers to curb electricity use during times of peak demand (“demand response”), and investing in technology such as smart meters, which allows customers to track their energy usage—among many other strategies. These efforts, which save consumers money, can also manifest in lowered operating costs for electric utilities because they can reduce peak demand. Furthermore, depending on the sentiment of the utilities commission in a company’s region, energy efficiency can be a regulatory priority before new builds are considered. How an electric utility stands to gain or lose from this trend toward GHG mitigation is significantly predicated on its regulatory environment. Traditional rate structures generally do not give electric utilities an incentive for energy efficiency, and further, they may economically suffer from reductions in customer demand. This is increasingly driving electric utilities, and their regulators and customers, to pursue alternative ratemaking. Such alternative rate design often “decouples” utility revenues from customer consumption, and may also build in explicit incentives for end-use efficiency and demand reductions. Overall, companies whose strategic plan strives to reduce their downside risks from demand fluctuations, gain adequate and timely returns on needed efficiency investments. Further, lowering costs through efficiency initiatives help position utility companies to earn stronger risk- adjusted returns over the long term.",0,,,,,114,1,,,,,,False,,,43,False
295,"A de facto objective of regulated electric utilities is to provide reliable, affordable, and sustainable electricity. Companies in the industry are tasked with managing these potentially competing priorities to maintain favorable relations with customers and regulators—and ultimately to earn appropriate returns for shareholders. The affordability of energy is particularly challenging for companies to balance, as it often conflicts with other core objectives. Utility energy bills are widely perceived to be increasingly unaffordable for low-income customers (affordability is determined by both the net cost of energy bills and the underlying customer economics). Ensuring that utility bills are affordable is crucial for utilities working to build trust (intangible asset value) with regulators and customers. Quality of regulatory relations is a key value driver for utilities, and one of the more closely analyzed issues by investment analysts. The willingness of regulators to grant rate requests, rate structure modifications, cost recovery, and allowed returns is a primary determinant of financial performance and investment risk. Effectively managing affordability may enable utilities to invest more capital, favorably revise rate structures, and increase allowed returns. Furthermore, utilities that do not effectively manage affordability are increasingly exposed to customers defecting from the grid (or reducing reliance on the grid) by implementing distributed energy resources or pursuing other alternative energy sources (e.g., industrial customers’ use of combined heat and power). Managing affordability involves operating an efficient business with a well-thought-out, long-term perspective and strategy, as well as working closely with regulators and public policymakers on rate structures and, potentially, bill- assistance programs. While the precise nature of financial impacts of affordability are largely determined by utilities’ business models and rate structures, affordability is a critical business issue for utilities to manage in terms of maintaining (and growing) customer bases, building intangible asset value, creating investment and return opportunities, and ultimately delivering shareholder returns.",0,,,2022-12-13T09:53:25+01:00,,115,1,,,,6139.0,,True,,,43,False

The increased usage of smart grid technology has several benefits, including strengthening the resiliency of the grid to extreme weather events. However, this technology can make the grid more vulnerable to cyber attacks, as it provides hackers more entryways into infrastructure systems.

To mitigate such impacts, companies can both invest in more efficient water-usage systems for existing plants and water-related biodiversity risks when siting new power plants.</span></p>

330,"The Engineering & Construction Services industry works with clients that are exposed to potentially disruptive climate regulation as well as those that play a role in addressing climate change. Certain types of construction projects are significant contributors toward climate change due to the greenhouse gases (GHGs) emitted during their use phase. Projects that are likely to contribute to global GHG emissions include those in the oil and gas space and other extractives industries, as well as large buildings. While some infrastructure projects, such as renewable energy projects, are designed to reduce GHG emissions, many types of projects present trade-offs. Mass transit systems, for example, may be direct contributors of GHG emissions while lowering net emissions once the benefits offered by the system are factored in. Several companies in the industry generate a substantial share of revenues and profits from clients in carbon-intensive industries and whose future capital expenditures may be at risk due to evolving climate regulations. Downside risks may manifest through project delays, cancellations, and diminished long-term revenue growth opportunities. On the other hand, companies that specialize in infrastructure projects that contribute to GHG mitigation could develop competitive advantages as they continue to focus on these growing markets. As the industry and its customers continue to operate within an uncertain business environment and face increasing environmental and regulatory requirements, assessing and communicating the risks and opportunities stemming from climate change that are embedded in a company's backlog and future business prospects can be helpful for investors in assessing the overall impact of climate change on the business.",0,,,,,119,1,,,,,,False,,,47,False
332,"Infrastructure construction projects help improve economic and social development; however, they can also pose risks to the local environment and surrounding communities. Industry activities can disrupt local ecosystems through biodiversity impacts, emissions into the air, water discharges, natural resource consumption, waste generation, and the use of hazardous chemicals. In particular, construction companies perform clearing, grading, and excavation activities and may generate harmful waste during project construction. Effectively assessing environmental impacts prior to construction may help mitigate unforeseen issues that can raise operational and capital costs. In some cases, environmental concerns and/or local community pushback can result in project delays and, in extreme cases, project cancellations, which may impact a company’s profitability and growth opportunities. A failure to comply with environmental regulations during construction can result in costly fines and remediation costs, and can damage a company’s reputation. Environmental impact assessments can provide an understanding of a project’s potential environmental impacts and the mitigation activities that may be necessary before it begins. Likewise, proper management of environmental risks during project construction can reduce regulatory oversight and/or community pushback. By assessing environmental considerations up front, as well as continuing to evaluate them during project development, engineering and construction companies may be better prepared to mitigate the potential environmental issues and financial risks that may occur, while also establishing a competitive advantage for obtaining new contracts with prospective clients.",0,,,,,120,1,,,,,,False,,,47,False

Companies with business models that incorporate ongoing assessments of climate change risks, and adapt to such risks, are likely to more effectively grow company value over the long term, partially through reductions in risk. More specifically, strategies focused on home development activities in floodplains and coastal regions that are exposed to extreme weather events, such as flooding, have increased needs for their business models to adapt to climate change, especially considering long-term challenges like flood insurance rates, the financial stability of government-subsidized flood insurance programs, permitting approvals, and financing stipulations. Rising climate risks and the increasing cost of occupying properties in volatile regions may translate into reduced long-term demand, land value depreciation, and concerns over understated long-term costs of home ownership. Additionally, companies that build developments in water-stressed regions risk losing land value and may face problems with permitting approvals.

While IP protection is inherent to the business model of some companies in the industry and is an important driver of innovation, the IP practices of companies can be a contentious societal issue. Companies could sometimes acquire patents and other IP protection to restrict competition and access to benefits from innovation, particularly if they are dominant market players.

To ensure long-term, mutually beneficial relationships, companies need to provide services that satisfy the highest professional standards of the industry, which means taking measures to avoid conflicts of interest, misrepresentation, and negligence. Professional integrity also pertains to following a code of ethics with respect to transparency and disclosure.

At the same time, metals and mining companies often operate in areas where worker rights are not adequately protected. The nuances of both domestic and international worker concerns make management of labor relations critical for metals and mining companies. Conflict with workers can result in labor strikes and other disruptions that can delay or stop production. Work stoppages frequently result in significant lost revenue and reputational damage.

Discriminatory lending presents significant risks in the form of fines or settlements for violations of regulations such as the U.S. Equal Credit Opportunity Act (ECOA) or the U.S. Fair Housing Act (FHA), reputational risk, and negative financial performance due to loan mispricing. Disclosing processes in place to ensure non-discriminatory lending, disclosing the amount of mortgage lending broken down by minority status along with relevant financial characteristics, and disclosing the amount of monetary losses as a result of legal proceedings associated with violations of applicable laws and regulations will help investors to assess company performance.

Second, the lack of transparency provided to customers with respect to primary and add-on products may impact a company’s reputation and invite regulatory scrutiny and costly litigation. Finally, poor performance on the first two elements could affect the characteristics of the portfolio of products, resulting in a high concentration of risky products sold. Mortgage Finance industry regulators established significant consumer protection laws in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis that seek to limit the predatory lending practices that encouraged qualified and unqualified borrowers to assume subprime mortgages. In addition, these laws prohibit mortgage originators from receiving compensation that is tied to the value of the loan and require that additional disclosures be given to borrowers.

692,"Climate change affects companies in the industry via frequent or high-impact extreme weather events and changing climate patterns. The manner in which a company’s business model is structured to incorporate ongoing assessments of climate change risks, and the adaptation to such risks, is likely to be increasingly connected to company value over the long term. More specifically, investment strategies with assets located on floodplains and in coastal regions that are exposed to inclement weather may have increased needs around risk mitigation and business model adaptation to climate change over the long term. These strategies are especially important in light of the long-term challenges associated with flood insurance rates, the financial stability of government-subsidized flood insurance programs, and financing stipulations or other creditor concerns. Besides insurance, other risk mitigation measures include improvements to physical asset resiliency and lease terms that transfer risk to tenants, although these measures can create their own costs and risks for real estate companies. To ensure long-term growth and protection of shareholder value, companies need to implement climate change adaptation strategies that are comprehensive, account for trade-offs between various risk mitigation strategies, and integrate consideration of all projected costs and benefits over the long term.",0,,,,,133,1,,,,,,False,,,49,False
693,"Real estate assets consume significant amounts of energy, primarily related to space heating, ventilating, air conditioning, water heating, lighting, and the use of equipment and appliances. The type of energy used, magnitude of consumption, and strategies for energy management are highly dependent on the real estate asset class, among other factors. Generally, grid electricity consumption is the predominant form of consumed energy, though on-site fuel combustion and renewable energy production also serve an important roles. Energy costs may be borne by companies in the industry and/or the property occupants; either way, energy management is a significant industry issue. To the extent that the real estate owner assumes direct responsibility for energy costs, such costs often represent significant operating costs, inherently indicating the importance of energy management. Energy pricing volatility and a general trend of electricity price increases, energy-related regulations, wide variations in energy performance across the existing building stock, and opportunities for efficiency improvements through economically attractive capital investments all further point to the importance of energy management. Energy costs assumed by occupants, either in whole or in part, are nonetheless likely to significantly impact companies in the industry, albeit through differing channels. Building energy performance is a notable driver of tenant demand, as it allows them to control operating costs, mitigate the environmental impacts of operations, and, often just as importantly, maintain a reputation for resource conservation. Additionally, real estate owners may be exposed to energy-related regulations even when energy costs are the responsibility of occupants. Overall, companies in the industry that effectively manage the energy performance of their assets may see reduced operating costs and regulatory risks, as well as increased tenant demand, rental rates, and occupancy rates—all of which drive revenue and asset value appreciation. Improving the energy performance of assets is highly dependent on property type and location, target tenant market, local building codes, physical and legal opportunities to deploy distributed renewable energy, ability to measure consumption, and performance of existing building stock, among other factors.",0,,,,,9,1,,,,,,False,,,49,False

696,"Real estate assets generate significant sustainability impacts, including resource consumption—namely energy and water —waste generation, and impacts on occupant health through indoor environmental quality. While companies in the industry own real estate assets, it is the tenant operations of such assets that is a dominant driver of sustainability impacts produced by the built environment. Tenants may design and construct leased spaces according to their operating needs. In turn, their operations consume significant amounts of energy and water, generate waste, and impact the health of those living, working, shopping, or visiting the properties. While these sustainability impacts are often generated by tenant operations and activities, real estate owners have an important role in influencing tenant sustainability impacts. The manner in which companies in the industry structure their agreements, contracts, and relationships with tenants is instrumental in effectively managing the sustainability impacts of their tenants, and ultimately, the impacts of their assets. Managing tenant sustainability impacts may include mitigating the problem of split incentives by aligning both parties’ financial interests with sustainability outcomes, establishing systematic measurement and communication of resource consumption data, creating shared performance goals, and mandating minimum sustainability performance or design requirements, among other strategies.

778,"Given the systemic importance of telecommunications networks, systemic or economy-wide disruption may be created if the network infrastructure of telecommunication services companies is unreliable and prone to business continuity risks. As the frequency of extreme weather events associated with climate change increases, telecommunication services companies will face growing physical threats to network infrastructure, with potentially significant social or systemic impacts. In the absence of resilient and reliable infrastructure, companies may face lost revenue associated with service outages and unplanned capital expenditures to repair damaged or compromised equipment. Companies that successfully implement measures to address business continuity risks, including an identification of critical business operations, or to enhance resilience of the system are likely to substantially reduce their risk exposure and, hence, lower their cost of capital. While implementation of such measures may have upfront costs, companies are likely to see long-term benefits in terms of lower remediation expenses in cases of high-impact disruptions.",0,,,2022-12-13T13:02:40+01:00,,225,1,,,,6139.0,,True,,,68,False
779,"Due to the rapid obsolescence of communications devices, particularly mobile phones, they represent an increasing proportion of electronic waste (e-waste) going to landfills, driven in part by a low recycling rate. Telecommunication services companies face growing regulatory risks related to this issue. Multiple jurisdictions have implemented e-waste recycling laws mandating that electronics retailers and manufacturers create a system for recycling, reuse, or proper disposal of electronic devices. While many of these laws in their early days covered a limited scope of products, newer laws extend to mobile devices requiring companies to finance the collection, treatment, recycling, or proper disposal of e- waste, as concerns around e-waste from communications devices increase. E-waste laws often require vendors or manufacturers to pay for the recycling of such waste or put in place product take-back and recycling programs. Penalties or costs, due to such laws, together with potential revenues generated from refurbishing and re-selling products, are increasingly providing incentives for companies in the industry to manage end-of-life impacts. Many telecommunication services companies work in partnership with phone manufacturers to bundle telecom services and mobile devices, and therefore have a shared responsibility for end-of-life management of such devices. Their relationship with customers provides an opportunity for effective management of product recycling, reuse, and disposal. Establishing take-back programs to recover end-of-life materials for further reuse, recycling, or remanufacturing can allow companies cost savings and more resilient supply of manufacturing materials.",0,,,,,231,1,,,,,,False,,,68,False
