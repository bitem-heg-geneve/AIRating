# AI-Raiting QA

## QA Description
A Question Answering model needs a context and a question to work out an answer.
It here takes as context the note sources. For the question we took the data points and first just asked what was the impact of this subject in this case. That was our first list of questions. We then used a llm to rephrase the questions.
Once we had a list of contexts and a list of questions we could try out llms to get answers.

## Files
- `20230125_tr_note_source.csv`: are the note's sources which we will use as contexts.
- `datapoints_2024-01-16T15 25 08.159208+01 00.csv` : is the list of the note's objects.
- `data.sql`: is all the data in SQL.
- `generated_answers.txt`: are the answers generated by the model for a certain context and question.
